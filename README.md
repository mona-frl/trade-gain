# CFG Final Project

## Must Have

- A minimun of 2 HTML web pages and one external CSS file
- Consistent navbar on all pages
- Styled Well
- All links working
- Basic user interaction (Ex: hover, submit, form, action on click)

## Nice to have 

- All of the 'must have criteria' +
- Mobile Responsive website
- Effective use of classes and IDs
- JavaScript used to enable user interaction

## My solution

- Me and Julia used purely HTML, CSS and took advantage of BootStrap 5 to style the pages.
